## Connect 4
This is a python command line game based on the classic Connect 4. You are playing against the computer and the computers moves are randomly generated. You are '1' and the computer is '2'. The code is self explanatory but essentially, it utilizes functions for the game mechanics. The board, which is 6 rows and 7 columns, is an array of arrays. The pieces iterate from the bottom up when being placed and the program checks to ensure a space is free before placing a piece down. Once the board is full or someone has got 4 pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally then gameplay stops. You are informed of who has won the current game, and asked whether or not you wish to play again.
