# Pong Game
### Made with Lua and the LOVE2D game engine

In order to make this game playable on your computer you have to install the LOVE2D game engine. This can be found [here](https://love2d.org/) and a getting started guide [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started). Then follow **option 1** or **option 2.**

#### Option 1
Download only the **pong.love** file. Once it is downloaded just double click on the file and the game should load up (provided you have downloaded LOVE2D).

#### Option 2
Download the **whole repository** by typing the below command into terminal. You need to have git for the command to work in terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/David-Sangojinmi/Projects/tree/master/Lua-Love2D/Pong
```
Then locate to the cloned repository on terminal and type
```
cd ..\
love Pong
``` 
The game should then load up after you have completed **option 1** or **option 2.**.

Then enjoy!
