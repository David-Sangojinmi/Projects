# Pong Game
### Made with Lua and the LOVE2D game engine

Left paddle controls: "w" and "s" key for up and down. Right paddle controls: "up" and "down" key for up and down. Press "Enter" when instructed.

In order to make this game playable on your computer you have to install the LOVE2D game engine. This can be found [here](https://love2d.org/) and a getting started guide [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started). Then follow **option 1** or **option 2.**

#### Option 1
Download only the **pong.love** file. Once it is downloaded just double click on the file and the game should load up (provided you have downloaded LOVE2D).

#### Option 2
Download the **whole repository** by typing the below command into terminal. You need to have git for the command to work in terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/David-Sangojinmi/Projects/tree/master/Lua-Love2D/Pong
```
Then locate to the cloned repository on terminal and type
```
cd ..\
love Pong
``` 
The game should then load up after you have completed **option 1** or **option 2.**.

Then enjoy!
